To do:
Generate 500 (5*5*5*4) number of particles either using fcc bcc etc as the starting point
Set size of unit cell a=5.3 A 
sigma = 3.4 A 
Epsilon = 1KJ/mol
Start MC simulation 
Generate n'=n*2-1
Calculate potential for every change for all particles less than 3 sigma from it
Based on change in potential calculate the probability  (To accept or reject)
Set alpha value such that acceptance rate is around 50%
Calculate energy for each state -> To calculate average energy and plot it to get mean value -> which will be the convergent value of the system
